Its obsidian-black blade absorbs surrounding light, casting an eerie darkness wherever it is drawn. They say the sword is cursed with the essence of a betrayed general, his soul now bound within the steel. Each swing echoes his vengeful wail, and in the dead of night, the bladeâ€™s edge becomes nearly invisible, allowing its wielder to strike unseen. The longer it remains unsheathed, the colder the air grows, as if the shadows themselves are answering its call.",
