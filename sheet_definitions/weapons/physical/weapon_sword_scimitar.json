This scimitar was once the prized possession of a nomadic warlord who conquered vast stretches of the desert. Infused with the essence of a sandstorm, wielders of this blade are said to move with the speed and ferocity of the desert wind itself, their strikes as relentless as the ever-shifting sands.",
