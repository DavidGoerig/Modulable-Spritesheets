Its blade gleams with the fiery glow of molten metal, hinting at the **FEU** enchantment coursing through its edge. With every swing, it leaves a faint trail of embers in the air. Legends say Braxigar used this halberd to strike down the **Ashbound Colossus**, embedding his name in myth and battle songs. The weapon now waits for a warrior worthy of its rage.",
