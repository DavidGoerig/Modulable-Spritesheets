Forged from enchanted graysteel, this armor is said to contain traces of the essence of **TENEBRE**, offering subtle protection from shadow-infused attacks. Legends tell of it being worn by the human knight **Sir Eadric the Veiled**, a warrior of the Obsidian Order who once traversed the **Shadewood Hollow**, where light was scarce and darkness reigned supreme. The chainmail absorbed the whispers of the forest, and its wearer was never caught unaware.",
