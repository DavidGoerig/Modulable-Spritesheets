Traditionally used by the **Clerics of Solara**, they are known to quicken the healing of wounds and nullify the effects of poison. Rumor has it that the soul of **Sister Elira**, a martyred healer, lingers within each thread, ensuring that no injury treated with them is ever left to fester. Soldiers who wore these bandages during the **Siege of Moonshadow Keep** claimed to hear Elira's voice guiding them to safety in the fog of war.",
