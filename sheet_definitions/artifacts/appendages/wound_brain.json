During a duel that shook the very fabric of reality, one combatant managed to penetrate the mental defenses of the other, causing a cerebral wound that not only impaired cognitive functions but also unleashed chaotic psychic abilities. This wound pulses with a dark energy, occasionally emanating whispers of thoughts that were never meant to be heard. It serves as a potent reminder of the dangers inherent in wielding mind-altering powers without restraint.",
